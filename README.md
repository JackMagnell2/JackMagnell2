## Hi there 👋

I am currently working on some personal projects outside of school. Primarily, my focus lies on a randomizer website that lets users play around with a bunch of fun tools they might need. Feel free to check it out on randomizerkit.com! Besides this project, I have done a lot of work in school. I aim to publish a lot more personal public repositories with a bunch of interesting work!

This semester at university, I have been taking a course called "Advanced Database Systems" which is what I am currently focusing on in that aspect. I believe databases are super important to learn and know about, so this course feels perfect. Besides that course, I am also taking some non-programming courses since I am on my fifth semester and we had a lot of options. One of those courses is "Film and History" which I find to be very interesting.

Please do not hesitate to contact me about pretty much anything, my email can be found on my profile!
